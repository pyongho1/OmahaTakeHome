# Database Schema

This document provides basic guidance for the database structure of the EcoVision: Climate Visualizer. 

## Data Requirements

Your database should store:

1. Location information
   - Geographic coordinates
   - Names and regions
   - Any other location metadata you think is relevant

2. Climate metrics information
   - Different types of measurements (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
   - Units and descriptions
   - Any metadata needed for analysis

3. Climate measurements
   - The actual readings/values
   - Timestamps
   - Data quality indicators
   - Relationships to locations and metrics

## Implementation Notes

- Choose any database system you prefer (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), just be sure to include detailed documentation on how to setup your database.
- Design your schema to efficiently support the API requirements
- Consider how to optimize for the trend analysis and quality-weighted calculations
- Sample data is provided in `/data/sample_data.json`
- You'll need to implement logic to seed your database with this data
- Think about indexing and query performance
- Consider data integrity and constraints

The exact implementation (tables, columns, relationships, etc.) is up to you! Design your schema to best support the requirements outlined in the API specification.
